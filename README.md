ZamAutoSat - Auto saturation plugin.

This is a gentle automatic saturator with no controls that 
can be applied safely to any channel for boosting quiet sounds
and lowering sounds that are too loud for the channel.

Using simple absolute value algorithm. (Thanks to naptastic).

Feel free to leave comments on my blog as all feedback is appreciated.
